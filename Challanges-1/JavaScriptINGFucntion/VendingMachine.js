/* 2) Your task is to create a function that simulates a vending machine.

Given an amount of money (in cents Â¢ to make it simpler) and a productNumber, 
the vending machine should output the correct product name and give back the 
correct amount of change.

The coins used for the change are the following: [500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10]

The return value is an object with 2 properties:

- product: the product name that the user selected.
- change: an array of coins (can be empty, must be sorted in descending order).

Examples
vendingMachine(products, 200, 7) ---> { product: "Crackers", change: [ 50, 20, 10 ] }
vendingMachine(products, 500, 0) ---> "Enter a valid product number"
vendingMachine(products, 90, 1) ---> "Not enough money for this product"

Notes:
- If productNumber is invalid (out of range) you should return the string: "Enter a valid product number".
- If money is not enough to buy a certain product you should return the string: "Not enough money for this product".
- If there's no change, return an empty array as the change. */
